		"Wow, thanks for the trust you put in me. Also, pretty bold to say that for the woman that was too scared to do it herself. Anyways, I did it, so could you please tell me...",
		"Don’t you dare say I was scared of a simple beast again! I am a true Mandalorian warrior, you’d know what that means if you were really one of us, and not one of those fools from your cult. If I asked you to do it it’s just because I wanted to test you.",
		"Test me? Test me for what?",
		"Well, as you already know, I’m trying to retake Mandalore. I just wanted to see if you were a worthy warrior, strong enough to help us bring our home world back to its glory days. And you have proven yourself indeed, so I want you to accompany us in this important mission.",
		"Look, everyone knows Mandalore is cursed, i wouldn’t go there if I were you. Besides that I already have a mission, I have to protect this kid. And to do that I need the information you promised me, so if you are kind enough...",
		"I see… Let’s make another deal. I’ll give you the information you need if, in exchange, you help me retake Mandalore once you are done with your “far more important” mission. I think your abilities would really help us, and it’s your duty if you truly are a Mandalorian.",
		"Wait, this doesn’t seem fair. We already made a deal, remember?",
		"Come on, was this even an inconvenience to you, killing that Rancor? Because if that’s the case maybe I got the wrong person for the job. Maybe you are not a true Mandalorian warrior after all…",
		"Alright, alright.. I’ll help you retake Mandalore, but only after I’m done with my mission. No matter how long it takes.",
		"Ok Mando, as you wish. I’ll be waiting for you to finish whatever it is you’re doing, gathering as many warriors I can to help us. Now to the information you wanted; our fellow friend Ahsoka Tano. Can I ask why you want to know where she is?",
		"No, you cannot. I need her help with the kid, that’s what you need to know.",
		"Fair enough, I guess it’s none of my business. She is at Dathomir, last thing I heard she was investigating something about the Force in a Nightsisters temple. But you know what they say about that planet; if you think Mandalore is cursed you won’t like Dathomir. Stories of dead people walking, deadly creatures… and not to mention the Nightbrothers. I still vividly remember the only two I’ve known… and how they overthrew Mandalore’s government once.",
		"* Snaps out* Look I don’t want to bore you with old stories.  The important thing is that you should be careful there.",
		"It’s ok, I’ll be fine. Thanks for everything, Bo-Katan.",
		"You’re welcome. Can I ask for one last thing before you go?",
		"I hope it’s not another one of your deals.",
		"Nothing of that. When you find Ahsoka, could you ask her if she’d like to help us with our mission?",
		"No problem. See you soon, Bo-Katan.",
		"May the force be with you, friend.",
