        <h3>All about Diamond Engine</h3>
        <p>
            Diamong Engine is a lightweight 3D (and future 2D) game development engine. This engine 
            was developed as part of a college assigment. The engine supports almost every editor 
            feature that you could expect from a game development engine, but the most relevant feature 
            is the added support to interpret and work with C# code on a component based GameObject system.
        </p>
        <p>
            The C# implementation was mainly focused on making it as fast an reliable as possible. 
            This implementation uses the mono runtime working with JIT to execute C# code at runtime.
            Whit this implementation and the app-domain system, it is also possible to recompile code 
            at runtime to make the iteration time as fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the performance and the reliable dynamic memory managment, the engine is also 
            focused on being visualy atractive to the users. Also new features are being added to make
             the engine able to generate bigger and better games.

              <p>
                  Hi, I'm Mayk. I'm the only developer involved on the "Diamond Engine" project, and 
                  i've been working on it since early 2020. (explain here all about you and the project maybe?)</p>
              <p>
                  I've been coding and making "games" since I was 14 and when I saw a chance to start 
                  developing my own engine I really tried my best to do something i could be proud of. 
                  My first contact with the Game Development word was thanks to the Unity Engine, and 
                  I allways wanted to know how it was made.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Working on Diamond Engine was, and still is, the better way for me to learn new things,
                   and I really enjoy 3D math and coding so it was perfect. I really think this engine 
                   reflects what I'm capable of as in 2020, and I plan to get better.
              </p>

        <ul style="display: grid; list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>
                <h4>Optimized 3D rendering</h4>
                <p>
                    OpenGL rendering was optimized avoiding deprecated methods and systems, and its 
                    performance was also improved by rendering as much as possible with retained mode.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Camera Culling</h4>
                <p>
                    Scene rendering time was reduced with camera culling, camera frustrum and AABB boxes 
                    to discard all the meshes outside the camera view. A future improvement will be made 
                    by adding space partitioning 
                    <a href="https://maykoder.github.io/Space-Partitioning/">
                        (a field I made a small study of back in 2018 that can be readed here).
                    </a>
                </p>

            <li>
                <h4>GameObject & Component System</h4></li>
            <li>
                <h4>Multi-viewport Rendering</h4></li>
            <li>
                <h4>Memory managment</h4></li>
            <li>
                <h4>Time Managment</h4>
                <p>
                    The time managment system makes it possible to start/stop/pause/step a simulation that 
                    will also run other systems (like shaders, particles...). The content played during this 
                    simulation will be the exact content played/displayed when the game is compiled and 
                    executed as a standalone application.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Resource Manager</h4>
                <p>
                    Resource managment systems make sure that we don't use more memory than we really need by 
                    only loading resources once to memory, and then the system will assign references (pointers) 
                    to those loaded resources. This system reduces drasticly the memory usage of the application 
                    and the final game.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Style Customization</h4>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Screenshoot System</h4>
                <p>
                    A small screenshoot system was added to the editor that allows the user to capture simulation 
                    moments or editor frames as .PNG files.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>C# Sub-System</h3>

            <p></p>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, Diamond Engine has a C#/Mono implementation, making it perfect for faster 
                code iterations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This implementation makes heavy use of extern methods to send and recieve data from C++ and C#, 
                which are connected.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest performance optimizations was achieved by sending C++ pointers to the C# objects 
                as UINT64 values, and then, when we need to retrieve some data from C++ to use on C#, we just have 
                to send and cast that pointer UINT64 to C++ and then send the data that we need to C#.
            </p>
            <p>
                As trivial as this may sound, this small detail reduced considerably the C++/C# communication 
                time, which also made Update times a lot faster.
            </p>

            <p>
                Talk about the exception handling and how good the fields are managed to auto-fill on scene loading 
                and how well managed the code is to block crashes from GaneObject maniulation. Also talk about how 
                there is 0 memory leaks and how the memory is stable during scene loading, script loading and even 
                C# dynamic GameObject creation.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the left gif we can see 
            </p>

            <p>
                Also on the right gif we can appreciate 
            </p>

            <p>
                Talk about the perfect memory managment, the 0 memory leaks, the hot-reloading, hot the script variables 
                auto-fill on restart. Also talk about the scripts adding themself to the Visual Studio Solution and hot 
                they are linked via code to avoid file duplication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I'm adding an XML parser because i hate myself. Talk how the sln is perfect and the solution links work perfect too.
            </p>
