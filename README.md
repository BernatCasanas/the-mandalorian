# The Mandalorian: Ashes of the Empire

The Mandalorian: Ashes of the Empire is fast-paced roguelite with an emphasis on ranged combat and constant repositioning. The player controls Din Djarin, the Mandalorian. Readying himself before a crucial mission, Mando shares a drink with his allies in a canteen, remembering and retelling a past mission in which he took on a crusade against Moff Gideon.

Disclaimer: play using headphones & a controller.
