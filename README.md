# The Mandalorian: Ashes of the Empire

The Mandalorian: Ashes of the Empire is fast-paced roguelite with an emphasis on ranged combat and constant repositioning. The player controls Din Djarin, the Mandalorian. Readying himself before a crucial mission, Mando shares a drink with his allies in a canteen, remembering and retelling a past mission in which he took on a crusade against Moff Gideon.

## Game Keys

### Controller

* Left Joystick
	- Move Mando arround / Move arround when shooting / Navigate through the menus.

* R2
	- Dash, incresing your speed momentarily in the direction of your movement. This makes moving & Shooting unavaliable for the duration of the action; also makes the fire rate of the shooting faster.
	
* A
	- Select items in the menus & pass dialogues.
	
* X
	- Shoot, becoming still in the process, & using the Left Joystick to aim. This weapon has a "Heat mechanic", the more you use it, the less fire rate it will have; if you over do it the weapon will enter in a "overheat" state where you will be not able to shot until it has completly cooled down. You can cool it down by not shooting or by using the other weapons.
	
* Y
	- Grenade Launcher, becoming still in the process, & using the Left Joystick to aim. Shoots grenades that explode on contact with the ground or in a few seconds; once it explodes it deploys an area that hits consecutively in an area. You can't thoew another set of grenade until every single one has disapeared.

* B
	- Sniper Shot, becoming still in the process, & using the Left Joystick to aim. Holding down this button makes the Mandalorian charge his sniper rifle, once you release it you shot the bullet with less or more damage depending on the charge. If the sniper laser is red, it is undercharged; if it is yellow is optimally charged and if it neeps between white & red is overchared & won't do as much damage. You have 2 sniper charges that regenerate with time.

* L2
	- Push Companion Skill, use the force through Grogu to channel a Force Wall in front of you, that propels forward and moves enemies and will fade with time.

* L1
	- Wall Companion Skill, use the force through Grogu to channel a Force Wall in front of you, that is static and will act as a cover as long as it as HP.

* Start
